# DATA-SCIENTIST-INTERNSHIP-TASK
This repository contains selected internship tasks focused on data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling using Python.
 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset
 Objective
To understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset using Python.
 Dataset
Iris Dataset
Approach
Loaded dataset using pandas
Inspected structure using .shape, .columns, and .head()
Generated statistical summary using .describe()
Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn:
Scatter plot (feature relationships)
Histogram (data distribution)
Box plot (outliers and spread)
📊 Results & Insights

Identified clear separation between species using petal length and width.

Observed distribution trends through histograms.

Box plots helped detect spread and possible outliers.

🛠 Skills Applied

Data loading & inspection

Basic EDA

Data visualization

#Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
 Objective

To predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

 Dataset

Loan Prediction Dataset

 Approach

Handled missing values using imputation techniques

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualized important features:

Loan Amount

Applicant Income

Education Level

Trained a classification model (Logistic Regression)

Evaluated model using:

Accuracy score

Confusion Matrix

 Results & Insights

Income and loan amount significantly influenced approval probability.

Logistic Regression provided reliable classification performance.

Confusion matrix helped evaluate prediction quality.

🛠 Skills Applied

Data cleaning

Feature visualization

Binary classification

Model evaluation

 Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
 Objective

To estimate medical insurance charges using regression modeling.

 Dataset

Medical Cost Personal Dataset

Approach

Cleaned and prepared dataset

Visualized relationships between:

Age & Charges

BMI & Charges

Smoking Status & Charges

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated model using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

 Results & Insights

Smoking status had the strongest impact on insurance charges.

Age showed positive correlation with medical cost.

Regression model effectively predicted claim amounts with reasonable error margin.
